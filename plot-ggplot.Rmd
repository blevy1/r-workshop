## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.





ggplot best for data in tidy format (i.e., a column for every variable, and a row for every observation).


Graphics with ggplot are built step-by-step, adding new elements as layers with a plus sign (+) between layers (note: this is different from the pipe operator, %>%. Adding layers in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

To create a bare-bones ggplot graph, we need to tell R three basic things:

1) We’re using ggplot2::ggplot()

2) Data we’re using & variables we’re plotting (i.e., what is x and/or y?)

3) What type of graph we’re making (the type of geom)

Generally, that structure will look like this:

ggplot(data = df_name, aes(x = x_var_name, y = y_var_name)) +
  geom_type()
  
  
  Breaking that down:

First, tell R you’re using ggplot()

Then, tell it the object name where variables exist (data = df_name)

Next, tell it the aesthetics aes() to specify which variables you want to plot

Then add a layer for the type of geom (graph type) with geom_*() - for example, geom_point() is a scatterplot, geom_line() is a line graph, geom_col() is a column graph, etc.

```{r}
##Label plot
gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))

##addt hings to plot

##make it scatter
gg_base+ geom_point()

##make it line
gg_base+ geom_line()

##make it bar
gg_base+ geom_col()

##make an area plot
gg_base+geom_area()
```


First, we’ll customize some aesthetics (e.g. colors, styles, axis labels, etc.) of our graphs based on non-variable values.

We can change the aesthetics of elements in a ggplot graph by adding arguments within the layer where that element is created.

Some common arguments we’ll use first are:

color = or colour =: update point or line colors

fill =: update fill color for objects with areas

linetype =: update the line type (dashed, long dash, etc.)

pch =: update the point style

size =: update the element size (e.g. of points or line thickness)

alpha =: update element opacity (1 = opaque, 0 = transparent)


GOOD REFERENCE FOR OPTIONS: http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour


Building on our first line graph, let’s update the line color to “purple” and make the line type “dashed”:


```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_line(
    color = "purple",
    linetype = "dashed"
  )
```
```{r}
 #color =, size =, and pch = (see ?pch for the different point styles, which can be further customized).

gg_base + 
  geom_point(color = "purple",
             pch = 17,
             size = 4,
             alpha = 0.5)
```
Example: Create a ggplot scatterplot graph where the size and color of the points change based on the number of visitors, and make all points the same level of opacity (alpha = 0.5). Notice the aes() around the size = and color = arguments.

Also: this is overmapped and unnecessary. Avoid excessive / overcomplicated aesthetic mapping in data visualization.

notice that the two arguments that do depend on variables are within aes(), but since alpha = 0.5 doesn’t depend on a variable then it is outside the aes() but still within the geom_point() layer.

```{r}
gg_base + 
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  )

gg_base + 
  geom_col(
    aes(fill = visitors),

  )

```



While every element of a ggplot graph is manually customizable, there are also built-in themes (theme_*()) that you can add to your ggplot code to make some major headway before making smaller tweaks manually.

Here are a few to try today (but also notice all the options that appear as we start typing theme_ into our ggplot graph code!):

theme_light()

theme_minimal()

theme_bw()

Here, let’s update our previous graph with theme_minimal():

```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```



5.8 Updating axis labels and titles

Use labs() to update axis labels, and add a title and/or subtitle to your ggplot graph.

```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_line(linetype = "dotted") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Annual park visitors",
    title = "Channel Islands NP Visitation",
    subtitle = "(1963 - 2016)"
  )
```



5.9 Combining compatible geoms

As long as the geoms are compatible, we can layer them on top of one another to further customize a graph.

For example, adding points to a line graph:

```{r}
gg_base +
  geom_line(color = "purple") +
  geom_point(color = "orange",
             aes(size = year),
             alpha = 0.5)

##Or, combine a column and line graph (not sure why you’d want to do this, but you can):

gg_base +
  geom_col(fill = "orange",
           color = "purple") +
  geom_line(color = "green")
```




5.10 Multi-series ggplot graphs

In the examples above, we only had a single series - visitation at Channel Islands National Park. Often we’ll want to visualize multiple series. For example, from the ca_np object we have stored, we might want to plot visitation for all California National Parks.

To do that, we need to add an aesthetic that lets ggplot know how things are going to be grouped. A demonstration of why that’s important - what happens if we don’t let ggplot know how to group things?

```{r}
ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors, group = park_name, color = park_name)) +
  geom_line()
```


```{r}
gg_np <- ggplot(data = ca_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors, group = park_name)) 


```


5.11 Faceting ggplot graphs

When we facet graphs, we split them up into multiple plotting panels, where each panel contains a subset of the data. In our case, we’ll split the graph above into different panels, each containing visitation data for a single park.

Also notice that any general theme changes made will be applied to all of the graphs.

```{r}
gg_np +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "year", y = "annual visitors") +
  facet_wrap(~ park_name)
```


5.12 Exporting a ggplot graph with ggsave()


If we want our graph to appear in a knitted html, then we don’t need to do anything else. But often we’ll need a saved image file, of specific size and resolution, to share or for publication.

ggsave() will export the most recently run ggplot graph by default (plot = last_plot()), unless you give it the name of a different saved ggplot object. Some common arguments for ggsave():

width =: set exported image width (default inches)

height =: set exported image height (default height)

dpi =: set dpi (dots per inch)


So to export the faceted graph above at 180 dpi, width a width of 8" and a height of 7", we can use:

```{r}
ggsave(here("figures", "np_graph.jpg"), dpi = 180, width = 8, height = 7)

##Notice that a .jpg image of that name and size is now stored in the figures\ folder within your working directory. You can change the type of exported image, too (e.g. pdf, tiff, eps, png, mmp, svg).
